Hangman Game
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 

In this instance, the player attempts to predict the word by suggesting letters within a range of six guesses after the computer selects it at random from my list of randomly produced words.

How the Game Works

1. The computer selects a word for you
2. You try guessing with a letter per entry
3. If you are correct, the game replaces the blanks with the letter in the right position it occupies.
4. If you enter a previously entered number, the computer informs you 
5. You have 6 lives which translates to an opportunity to be wrong only 6 times.
6. If it passes 6 times, it is game over.

Note: Inside the main.py I explained each line of code which I believe should be very helpful.
